# Performance of Machine and Deep Learning for Flow Pattern Classification

Due to recent advances in artificial intelligence, it is possible to tackle complex classification problems using machine learning and deep learning architectures. This scientific paper presents the performance of different artificial intelligence models to classify flow patterns. Thus, the development shows the best alternatives for this specific classification problem. The best models predict two-phase flow regimes (liquid and gas) in pipes. Flow patterns are affected by different physical variables: velocity, viscosity, density, and surface tension. Also, the flow pattern depends on the pipe's construction characteristics, such as the angle of inclination and the diameter. Considering that these variables influence the flow pattern, we selected the Shoham data set that contains 5675 samples with six different flow patterns. The variables that allow better training of the models are: speed, angle, and diameter. Based on the database, and with the combination of parameters,  it is possible train several models. The metrics determine the best models for the problem. An extensive set of metrics validated the results achieved. These results allow selecting the best machine learning algorithms and design of deep learning architectures, to classify flow patterns with a high degree of fidelity.
