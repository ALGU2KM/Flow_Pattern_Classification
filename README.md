# Performance of machine and deep learning for flow patterns classification

Due to recent advances in artificial intelligence, it is possible to tackle complex classification problems using machine learning algorithms and deep learning architectures. This scientific paper presents the performance of different artificial intelligence models to classify flow patterns. Thus, the development shows the best alternatives for this specific classification problem. The best models predict two-phase flow regimes (liquid and gas) in pipes. Flow patterns are affected by different physical variables like velocity, viscosity, density, and surface tension. It also depends on the pipeâ€™s construction features, such as the inclination angle and the diameter. Considering that these variables influence the flow pattern, we selected the Shoham data set containing 5675 samples with six different flow patterns. The variables that allow better training of the models are: velocity, angle of inclination, and diameter. Based on the database, and with the correct combination of parameters, it is possible to train several models. The metrics determine the best models for the problem. An extensive set of metrics validated the results achieved. These results allow selecting the best machine learning algorithm. The better model is Extra Trees that classifies flow patterns with a high degree of fidelity, obtaining 97% accuracy.
